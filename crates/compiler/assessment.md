# Current status of semantic crate

## 1. DONE ‚úÖ

This section covers features that are fully implemented, appear robust, and are
supported by comprehensive testing.

### 1.1. Core Semantic Infrastructure & Salsa Integration

The foundational data structures and database integration required for semantic
analysis are complete and follow the type plan's Salsa-first approach.

- **Salsa Database (`db.rs`):** The `SemanticDb` trait and its implementation
  `SemanticDatabaseImpl` are correctly set up, enabling incremental computation
  for all semantic queries. Proper inheritance from `ParserDb` with `Upcast`
  trait implemented.
- **All Salsa Query Framework:** Complete implementation of all planned tracked
  queries:
  - `semantic_index(file)` - Core semantic analysis entry point ‚úÖ
  - `resolve_ast_type()` - AST type expression to TypeId conversion ‚úÖ
  - `definition_semantic_type()` - Definition type resolution ‚úÖ
  - `expression_semantic_type()` - Expression type inference ‚úÖ
  - `struct_semantic_data()` - Struct type information ‚úÖ
  - `function_semantic_signature()` - Function signature resolution ‚úÖ
  - `are_types_compatible()` - Type compatibility checking ‚úÖ
- **Scope & Symbol Tracking (`place.rs`):** The system for tracking scopes
  (`Scope`, `ScopeKind`) and symbols/places within them (`Place`, `PlaceTable`)
  is fully implemented with proper hierarchical traversal. This forms a robust
  basis for symbol table management with all planned scope types (Module,
  Function, Namespace, Block).
- **Definition-AST Linking (`definition.rs`):** The `Definition` and
  `DefinitionKind` structures successfully link semantic symbols back to their
  corresponding AST nodes. All planned definition kinds are implemented
  (Function, Struct, Const, Let, Local, Parameter, Import, Namespace) with
  proper AST reference types.

### 1.2. Type System Representation (Following Type Plan Phase 1)

The data structures for representing types within the compiler are complete and
leverage Salsa interning exactly as specified in the type plan.

- **Core Type Representations (`types.rs`):** All planned interned types
  implemented:
  - `TypeId<'db>` (Salsa-interned) wrapping `TypeData` ‚úÖ
  - `TypeData` enum with all specified variants: Felt, Struct, Tuple, Pointer,
    Function, Unknown, Error ‚úÖ
  - `StructTypeId<'db>` (Salsa-interned) with definition linking, fields, and
    scope ‚úÖ
  - `FunctionSignatureId<'db>` (Salsa-interned) with parameters and return type
    ‚úÖ
- **Expression and Definition IDs:** All planned ID types implemented:
  - `ExpressionId` index type for AST expression tracking ‚úÖ
  - `DefinitionId<'db>` interned type combining file and local index ‚úÖ
  - Proper span-to-expression mapping in SemanticIndex ‚úÖ
- **Type System Methods:** Complete helper methods for type introspection:
  - Type classification (is_primitive, is_error, is_unknown, is_concrete) ‚úÖ
  - Display name generation for diagnostics ‚úÖ
  - Struct field lookup by name ‚úÖ
  - Function parameter introspection ‚úÖ

### 1.3. SemanticIndex Implementation (Core of Type Plan)

The SemanticIndex contains all planned components and successfully implements
the architectural vision from the type plan.

- **Complete SemanticIndex Structure:** All planned fields implemented:
  - Place tables indexed by FileScopeId ‚úÖ
  - Hierarchical scopes with parent relationships ‚úÖ
  - Definitions collection with proper indexing ‚úÖ
  - Expression tracking with ExpressionInfo and span mapping ‚úÖ
  - Use-def tracking for identifier resolution ‚úÖ
  - Identifier usage tracking for validation ‚úÖ
- **SemanticIndexBuilder:** Two-pass semantic analysis system:
  - First pass: Top-level declaration collection ‚úÖ
  - Second pass: Body processing with proper scope management ‚úÖ
  - Expression visitor creating ExpressionId assignments ‚úÖ
  - Proper scope stack management for nested constructs ‚úÖ

### 1.4. Validation Framework (Extensible Architecture)

The framework for defining and running validation passes is fully implemented
and highly extensible, providing the foundation for type-dependent validators.

- **Validator Trait & Registry (`validation/validator.rs`):** The `Validator`
  trait, `ValidatorRegistry`, and the `create_default_registry` function provide
  a pluggable architecture for adding new semantic checks.
- **Diagnostic System (`validation/diagnostics.rs`):** The diagnostic collection
  and formatting system (`Diagnostic`, `DiagnosticCollection`) is robust,
  providing clear and structured error/warning messages with proper severity
  levels and error codes.
- **Testing Infrastructure (`validation/tests/`):** The snapshot-based testing
  framework using `insta` and `ariadne` is fully functional and provides a
  powerful way to write and maintain tests for validation rules.

### 1.5. Scope Validation (Working Type-Independent Validation)

Validation of scope-related rules is complete and thoroughly tested with 63
passing tests.

- **`ScopeValidator` (`validation/scope_check.rs`):** This validator is fully
  implemented and correctly identifies:
  - **Undeclared Variables:** Using an identifier that has no definition in the
    current or parent scopes ‚úÖ
  - **Duplicate Definitions:** Defining the same name twice within the same
    scope ‚úÖ
  - **Unused Variables:** Defining a local variable or parameter that is never
    read ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** All scope validation features are tested
  with:
  - Basic functionality tests ‚úÖ
  - Integration tests with real Cairo-M code examples ‚úÖ
  - Edge case handling (nested scopes, parameter vs local scoping) ‚úÖ
  - Snapshot testing for regression prevention ‚úÖ

## 2. ONGOING üîÑ

This section covers features that have a partial or placeholder implementation.
The foundation is laid according to the type plan, but the logic is incomplete.

### 2.1. Type Resolution and Inference (Core Type Plan Phase 1)

This is the most significant area of ongoing work. The Salsa query framework is
complete, but several implementation gaps prevent full type resolution.

- **File:**
  `/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/semantic/src/type_resolution.rs`
- **What Exists:**
  - `resolve_ast_type`: Can resolve primitive types (`felt`), pointers, tuples,
    and user-defined types (like structs) by looking them up in the semantic
    index. Proper context scope resolution implemented.
  - `struct_semantic_data` & `function_semantic_signature`: Correctly build
    `StructTypeId` and `FunctionSignatureId` from their definitions using Salsa
    interning.
  - `definition_semantic_type`: Can determine the type of definitions that have
    explicit type annotations (e.g., function parameters, structs).
  - `expression_semantic_type`: Has a basic implementation that can infer types
    for:
    - Literals (always `felt`) ‚úÖ
    - Identifiers (by looking up their definition's type) ‚úÖ
    - Member access (`p.x`) with struct field resolution ‚úÖ
    - Binary operations (basic implementation assuming `felt`) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - `are_types_compatible`: A basic implementation exists that checks for
    equality, pointers, and tuples.
- **Critical Implementation Gaps:**
  - **Definition-Expression Linking Issue:** The biggest blocker is that
    `DefinitionKind` variants for `Let`, `Local`, and `Const` don't properly
    store their `value_expr_id`. All are currently `None`, making type inference
    impossible for untyped variables.
  - **Inefficient AST Access:** Using span-based AST node lookup in
    `find_expression_in_module` is acknowledged as inefficient and unreliable.
  - **Missing Cycle Handling:** No Salsa `cycle_fn` implementation for recursive
    type inference scenarios.
  - **Incomplete Expression Coverage:** Many expression types fall back to
    `TypeData::Unknown`.
- **What's Left to Do:**
  - Fix `SemanticIndexBuilder` to properly link definitions to their value
    expressions
  - Implement efficient AST node access pattern
  - Add cycle detection for recursive type scenarios
  - Complete expression type inference for all AST expression variants
  - Enhance type compatibility checking beyond basic equality

### 2.2. Type-Dependent Validators (Type Plan Phase 2)

A complete suite of type-based validators has been architected following the
type plan, but they are all placeholders awaiting the completed type system.

- **Files:**
  - `/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/semantic/src/validation/struct_field_validator.rs`
  - `/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/semantic/src/validation/function_call_validator.rs`
  - `/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/semantic/src/validation/indexing_validator.rs`
  - `/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/semantic/src/validation/struct_literal_validator.rs`
- **What Exists:**
  - Complete `Validator` implementations with proper trait conformance
  - Detailed TODO comments outlining the exact implementation steps needed
  - Proper integration points with the validator registry system
  - All planned from the type plan Phase 2 priorities
- **What's Left to Do:**
  - **`StructFieldValidator`**: Implement logic using
    `expression_semantic_type()` to get object type, verify it's a struct via
    `TypeData::Struct`, and check field existence using
    `StructTypeId.field_type()`
  - **`FunctionCallValidator`**: Implement arity checking and argument type
    validation using the completed type queries
  - **`IndexingValidator`**: Implement pointer/array type checking for index
    operations
  - **`StructLiteralValidator`**: Implement comprehensive struct literal
    validation using struct semantic data
  - Add all validators to `create_default_registry()` once implemented

### 2.3. Semantic Index Builder Enhancements

The `SemanticIndexBuilder` has the correct architecture but needs completion of
expression-definition linking.

- **File:**
  `/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/semantic/src/semantic_index.rs`
- **What Exists:**
  - Correct two-pass system (declarations then bodies) ‚úÖ
  - Proper scope hierarchy construction ‚úÖ
  - Expression visitor creating ExpressionId assignments ‚úÖ
  - Use-def resolution and marking ‚úÖ
- **What's Left to Do:**
  - Store `ExpressionId` in `DefinitionKind::Let/Local/Const` value_expr_id
    fields
  - Link variable definitions to their initializer expressions during building
  - Complete all TODO comments for validator integration points
  - Improve expression-to-definition relationship tracking

### 2.4. Type System Robustness

Several architectural improvements needed for production readiness.

- **Error Propagation:** `TypeData::Error` and `TypeData::Unknown` exist but
  need sophisticated cascading prevention logic
- **Struct Field Access:** Currently using `Vec<(String, TypeId)>` instead of
  `IndexMap` due to Salsa compatibility issues (noted in TODO comments)
- **Type Display:** Basic display names implemented but could be enhanced for
  better diagnostics

---

## 3. NOT STARTED ‚ùå

This section covers essential semantic analysis features that align with type
plan Phase 3 and beyond, but have not yet been implemented.

### 3.1. Advanced Type System Features (Type Plan Future Phases)

- **Cycle Detection:** No Salsa `cycle_fn` implementations for handling
  recursive type inference scenarios
- **Advanced Type Compatibility:** Only basic equality checking; no subtyping,
  coercion, or advanced compatibility rules
- **Generic Types:** No support for parameterized types (if planned for Cairo-M
  future)
- **Complex Type Operations:** No type arithmetic, inference improvements, or
  advanced type system features

### 3.2. Advanced Semantic Analysis (Beyond Core Type Plan)

- **Control Flow Analysis:**

  - There is no analysis of code reachability (e.g., detecting code after a
    `return` statement) or definite initialization (ensuring variables are
    assigned a value before being used). This is mentioned as a future goal in
    `scope_check.rs`.

- **Module System and Cross-File Resolution:**

  - The entire semantic analysis is currently confined to a single file. While
    `import` statements are parsed and a `DefinitionKind::Import` is created,
    there is no logic to actually resolve these imports by finding, parsing, and
    analyzing other source files.

- **Mutability and Assignment Validation:**
  - The language currently only has immutable `let` bindings. There is no
    concept of mutable variables.
  - There is no `AssignmentValidator`. The system does not check if the
    left-hand side of an assignment is a valid target (an l-value) or if the
    types are compatible.

### 3.3. Future Language Features

- **Advanced Type System Features:**

  - **Enums:** No support for sum types (enums).
  - **Traits/Interfaces:** No concept of traits for defining shared behavior.
  - **Generics:** No support for generic types or functions.
  - **Type Aliases:** No ability to create aliases for existing types.

- **Attribute/Decorator Processing:**
  - If Cairo-M supports attributes (e.g., `#[test]`, `#[derive(...)]`), there is
    no semantic analysis for them.

### 3.4. Performance and Tooling (Type Plan Architectural Considerations)

- **Granular Salsa Queries:** No fine-grained queries for specific semantic
  index parts (as mentioned in type plan for performance)
- **IDE Features:** Go-to-definition, hover info, symbol search infrastructure
  exists but not exposed
- **Workspace Analysis:** No multi-file or workspace-wide semantic analysis
- **Incremental Compilation:** Salsa foundation exists but not fully leveraged
  for partial invalidation

---

## Summary and Recommendations

The semantic analysis implementation has achieved **excellent foundational
architecture** that closely follows the type plan's vision. The Salsa
integration is production-ready, and the core semantic infrastructure is robust
with comprehensive testing (63 passing tests).

### Key Achievements vs Type Plan

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Architecture:** All core type representations and Salsa queries
  implemented
- ‚úÖ **SemanticIndex Design:** Complete implementation matching the type plan
  specification
- ‚úÖ **Validation Framework:** Extensible architecture ready for type-dependent
  validators
- ‚úÖ **Scope Analysis:** Complete working validation with comprehensive testing

### Critical Next Steps

1. **Fix Definition-Expression Linking** (Highest Priority): Complete the
   missing link between variable definitions and their value expressions in
   `SemanticIndexBuilder`
2. **Complete Type Resolution** (High Priority): Finish expression type
   inference and add cycle detection
3. **Activate Type Validators** (Medium Priority): Implement the placeholder
   type-dependent validators
4. **Enhance Robustness** (Ongoing): Add sophisticated error propagation and
   performance optimizations

The foundation is exceptionally strong and production-ready. The type system
architecture exactly matches the type plan's specifications, and the remaining
work is primarily completing the implementation details rather than
architectural changes.
