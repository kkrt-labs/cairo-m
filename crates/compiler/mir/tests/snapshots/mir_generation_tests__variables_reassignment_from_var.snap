============================================================
Source code:
// Tests reassigning one variable with the value of another.
fn test_reassignment() -> felt {
    let x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    x = y; // Should generate a load from y's address and a store to x's address.
    return x;
}

============================================================
Generated MIR:
module {
  // Function 0
  fn test_reassignment {
    entry: 0

    0:
      %0 = 10
      %1 = 20
      store %0, %1
      return %0

  }
