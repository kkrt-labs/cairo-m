Source code:

        struct Point { x: felt, y: felt }
        struct Counter { value: felt }

        fn test() -> felt {
            let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
            let c = Counter { value: 10 };
            let result = p + c;  // Two type errors, both should have suggestions
            return result;
        }
