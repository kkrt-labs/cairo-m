# Task: Fix Mem2Reg SSA Overly Restrictive Promotability and Offset Bugs

## Priority

HIGH

## Status

âœ… COMPLETED

## Why

The mem2reg SSA pass has two critical issues that significantly impact
optimization effectiveness and correctness:

1. **Overly Restrictive Promotability**: The current `DataLayout::is_promotable`
   check only allows types with `size == 1`, excluding U32 values which are 2
   slots but could be promoted as aggregate values. This restriction prevents
   promotion of U32 variables, leaving significant optimization opportunities on
   the table and forcing unnecessary memory operations for common U32
   arithmetic.

2. **Offset Handling Bugs**: The phi source tracking and rename_block function
   incorrectly handle non-zero offsets, leading to potential correctness issues.
   When accessing aggregate types through GEP instructions with constant
   offsets, the current implementation may not properly track values at
   different offsets, potentially causing miscompilation or crashes.

These issues impact both performance (missed optimizations on U32 values) and
correctness (incorrect offset handling), making this a high-priority fix.

## What

Two main issues need to be addressed:

### Issue 1: Promotability Restriction

**Location**:
`/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/mir/src/layout.rs:96-98`

The `is_promotable` method currently only allows single-slot types:

```rust
pub fn is_promotable(&self, ty: &MirType) -> bool {
    self.size_of(ty) == 1
}
```

This excludes U32 (2 slots) from promotion, even though the mem2reg pass could
handle U32 values by treating them as 2-element aggregates with proper phi
insertion for each slot.

### Issue 2: Offset Handling Bugs

**Location**:
`/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/mir/src/passes/mem2reg_ssa.rs:565-577`

In the phi source tracking code, the current implementation hardcodes offset 0:

```rust
// Add entry for the current block
// Phi nodes track values at offset 0
if let Some(current_value) =
    value_stacks.get(&(*alloc_id, 0)).and_then(|v| v.last())
```

This is incorrect for GEP-derived addresses that access non-zero offsets of
promoted allocations. The phi sources should use the correct offset
corresponding to the phi node's target offset.

**Also affected**: Line 405-411 where phi destinations are pushed to offset 0
regardless of the actual offset they represent.

## How

### Fix 1: Relax Promotability Restrictions

**File**: `/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/mir/src/layout.rs`

Replace the overly restrictive `is_promotable` method:

```rust
pub fn is_promotable(&self, ty: &MirType) -> bool {
    match ty {
        // Single-slot types are always promotable
        MirType::Felt | MirType::Bool | MirType::Pointer(_) => true,
        // U32 is promotable as a 2-slot aggregate
        MirType::U32 => true,
        // Small tuples and structs could be promotable with proper SROA
        // For now, keep conservative for complex aggregates
        MirType::Tuple(types) => {
            // Allow small tuples that are reasonable to promote
            let size = self.size_of(ty);
            size <= 4 && types.iter().all(|t| self.is_promotable(t))
        }
        MirType::Struct { fields, .. } => {
            // Allow small structs with promotable fields
            let size = self.size_of(ty);
            size <= 4 && fields.iter().all(|(_, t)| self.is_promotable(t))
        }
        // Don't promote function pointers, error types, etc.
        _ => false,
    }
}
```

### Fix 2: Correct Offset Handling in Phi Source Tracking

**File**:
`/Users/msaug/kkrt-labs/cairo-m/crates/compiler/mir/src/passes/mem2reg_ssa.rs`

**Step 2a**: Fix phi destination tracking (lines 396-416) When processing phi
nodes, determine the correct offset they represent:

```rust
// Process Phi nodes first - they define new values
let block = &mut function.basic_blocks[block_id];
for instruction in block.instructions.iter_mut() {
    if let InstructionKind::Phi { dest, .. } = &instruction.kind {
        // Find which allocation and offset this Phi is for
        for (alloc_id, phi_map) in phi_locations {
            if let Some(&phi_dest) = phi_map.get(&block_id) {
                if *dest == phi_dest {
                    // Determine the offset this phi represents
                    // For now, phi nodes represent offset 0 of allocations
                    // TODO: Extend to handle per-offset phi nodes for multi-slot types
                    let offset = 0; // This should be determined from phi semantics

                    value_stacks
                        .get_mut(&(*alloc_id, offset))
                        .unwrap()
                        .push(Value::operand(*dest));
                    stack_pushes.push(((*alloc_id, offset), 1));
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 2b**: Fix phi source assignment (lines 548-581) Use the correct offset
when assigning phi sources:

```rust
// Update Phi nodes in successors
let successors = function.basic_blocks[block_id].terminator.target_blocks();
for succ_id in successors {
    let succ_block = &mut function.basic_blocks[succ_id];
    for instruction in &mut succ_block.instructions {
        let phi_dest = if let InstructionKind::Phi { dest, .. } = &instruction.kind {
            Some(*dest)
        } else {
            None
        };

        if let Some(dest) = phi_dest {
            // Find which allocation this Phi is for
            for (alloc_id, phi_map) in phi_locations {
                if let Some(&expected_dest) = phi_map.get(&succ_id) {
                    if dest == expected_dest {
                        // Determine the offset this phi represents
                        // For multi-slot types, different phi nodes handle different offsets
                        let phi_offset = 0; // TODO: Extend for per-offset phi handling

                        if let Some(current_value) =
                            value_stacks.get(&(*alloc_id, phi_offset)).and_then(|v| v.last())
                        {
                            if let InstructionKind::Phi { sources, .. } =
                                &mut instruction.kind
                            {
                                sources.push((block_id, *current_value));
                            }
                        }
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 2c**: Extend phi insertion for multi-slot types (lines 291-338) Modify
`insert_phi_nodes` to create phi nodes for each offset of multi-slot types:

```rust
// Create Phi nodes in identified blocks
let mut alloc_phi_map = FxHashMap::default();
for &phi_block_id in &phi_blocks {
    // For multi-slot types, create phi nodes for each slot
    let type_size = DataLayout::new().size_of(&alloc.ty);

    if type_size == 1 {
        // Single phi for single-slot types
        let phi_dest = function.new_typed_value_id(alloc.ty.clone());
        alloc_phi_map.insert(phi_block_id, phi_dest);

        let phi_instr = Instruction::phi(phi_dest, alloc.ty.clone(), Vec::new());
        let block = &mut function.basic_blocks[phi_block_id];
        block.instructions.insert(0, phi_instr);

        self.stats.phi_nodes_inserted += 1;
    } else {
        // TODO: Multi-slot phi insertion - create one phi per slot
        // For now, skip multi-slot types until full SROA is implemented
        continue;
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Test 1: U32 Promotion

Create test case to verify U32 values are properly promoted:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_u32_promotion() {
    let mut function = MirFunction::new("test_u32".to_string());
    let entry_block_id = function.entry_block;

    // %0 = framealloc u32
    let alloc = function.new_typed_value_id(MirType::pointer(MirType::u32()));
    // store %0, 12345u32
    // %1 = load %0
    let loaded = function.new_typed_value_id(MirType::u32());

    // Build instructions for U32 allocation, store, and load
    function.basic_blocks[entry_block_id]
        .instructions
        .push(Instruction::frame_alloc(alloc, MirType::u32()));
    function.basic_blocks[entry_block_id]
        .instructions
        .push(Instruction::store(
            Value::operand(alloc),
            Value::integer(12345),
            MirType::u32(),
        ));
    function.basic_blocks[entry_block_id]
        .instructions
        .push(Instruction::load(
            loaded,
            MirType::u32(),
            Value::operand(alloc),
        ));

    let mut pass = Mem2RegSsaPass::new();
    let changed = pass.optimize(&mut function);

    // Verify U32 allocation was promoted
    assert!(changed);
    assert_eq!(pass.stats.allocations_promoted, 1);
    assert_eq!(pass.stats.stores_eliminated, 1);
    assert_eq!(pass.stats.loads_eliminated, 1);
}
```

### Test 2: Offset Handling

Create test to verify correct handling of GEP offsets with phi nodes:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_offset_phi_handling() {
    let mut function = MirFunction::new("test_offset".to_string());

    // Create an allocation and GEP access pattern that requires phi nodes
    // with non-zero offsets (simulating a tuple (felt, felt) access)

    // This test should verify that phi sources correctly track values
    // at different offsets and don't incorrectly use offset 0 for all cases

    // Implementation details depend on the final phi insertion strategy
    // for multi-slot types
}
```

### Test 3: Regression Testing

Ensure existing single-slot promotion still works correctly:

- Run existing mem2reg tests
- Verify felt and bool promotion unchanged
- Check that complex aggregates are still conservatively handled

## Impact

### Performance Improvements

1. **U32 Optimization**: U32 arithmetic operations will benefit from register
   allocation instead of memory operations, improving performance for
   integer-heavy computations
2. **Reduced Memory Traffic**: Fewer framealloc/store/load sequences for U32
   values
3. **Better Optimization Pipeline**: Promoted U32 values can benefit from
   subsequent SSA-based optimizations

### Correctness Improvements

1. **Offset Safety**: Proper offset handling prevents potential miscompilation
   when accessing aggregate types through GEP instructions
2. **Phi Correctness**: Accurate phi source tracking ensures SSA form integrity
   for all promoted types

### Future Enablement

1. **SROA Foundation**: The relaxed promotability rules and proper offset
   handling lay groundwork for full Scalar Replacement of Aggregates (SROA)
2. **Aggregate Optimization**: Small tuples and structs become candidates for
   promotion once the offset handling is fully implemented

This task addresses fundamental limitations in the mem2reg pass that currently
prevent optimization of common value types and could lead to correctness issues
with aggregate type access patterns.

## Implementation Summary

### Solution Implemented

Implemented a conservative but correct approach for U32 promotion:

1. **Relaxed promotability restrictions** in DataLayout to allow U32 and small
   aggregates
2. **Added special handling for U32** in mem2reg pass
3. **Protected against incorrect GEP handling** by marking U32 allocations with
   GEP access as escaping

### Changes Made

#### DataLayout (`layout.rs`)

- Modified `is_promotable` to allow:
  - U32 types (2 slots)
  - Small tuples (size â‰¤ 2) with promotable elements
  - Small structs (size â‰¤ 2) with promotable fields
- Updated tests to reflect new promotability rules

#### Mem2reg Pass (`mem2reg_ssa.rs`)

- Added special case handling for U32 in `find_promotable_allocations`:
  - U32 allocations are tracked for promotion
  - If a U32 allocation has any GEP operations, it's marked as escaping
  - This ensures correctness without per-slot phi support
- Single-slot types continue to work as before
- Added comprehensive test coverage for U32 promotion scenarios

### Testing Results

- âœ… All 58 MIR tests pass
- âœ… `test_u32_simple_promotion` - U32 promoted when accessed as whole
- âœ… `test_u32_with_gep_not_promoted` - U32 not promoted with GEP access
- âœ… `test_u32_not_promoted` - Complex U32 access patterns handled correctly
- âœ… Existing single-slot promotion tests still pass
- âœ… No regressions in functionality

### Impact

The implementation successfully:

- **Enables U32 optimization** for common cases (whole-value access)
- **Maintains correctness** by preventing promotion of U32 with partial access
- **Preserves existing behavior** for single-slot types
- **Lays groundwork** for future full SROA implementation

### Future Work

Full multi-slot phi insertion remains TODO. This would enable:

- U32 promotion with GEP access (per-slot tracking)
- Full struct/tuple scalar replacement
- More aggressive memory-to-register promotion

The current solution provides immediate benefits for U32 arithmetic while
maintaining correctness.
