# Optimization Patterns in Cairo-M

Cairo-M compiler implements various optimization patterns to improve performance
and reduce memory usage.

## Unused Variable Elimination

Variables that are declared but never used should be eliminated:

```cairo-m
fn test_unused_elimination() -> felt {
    let used = 5;
    let unused = 10;  // This should be eliminated
    let also_unused = used * 2;  // This should also be eliminated
    return used;
}
```

## Dead Code Elimination

Code that doesn't affect the final result should be removed:

```cairo-m
fn test_dead_code() -> bool {
    let a = 1;
    let b = 0;
    let result = a == b;  // This affects the return value
    let dead = a == 0;    // This doesn't affect anything
    return result;
}
```

## In-Place Updates

Variables that are updated in-place can be optimized:

```cairo-m
fn test_in_place_updates() -> felt {
    let x = 5;
    x = x + 1;  // In-place update
    let y = 10;
    y = y + x;  // Another in-place update
    return y;
}
```

## Single Argument Optimization

Function calls with a single argument can avoid unnecessary copies:

```cairo-m
fn increment(x: felt) -> felt {
    return x + 1;
}

fn test_single_arg_opt() -> felt {
    let n = 10;
    let result = increment(n);  // Argument already at top of stack
    return result;
}
```

## Argument Order Optimization

When function arguments are already in the correct order, no reordering is
needed:

```cairo-m
fn test_arg_order() -> felt {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    let z = 3;
    let w = 4;
    return process_four(x, y, z, w);  // Arguments in natural order
}

fn process_four(a: felt, b: felt, c: felt, d: felt) -> felt {
    return a + b + c + d;
}
```

## Loop Optimization

Loops with predictable patterns can be optimized:

```cairo-m
fn test_loop_optimization() -> felt {
    let i = 0;
    let sum = 0;
    while (i != 5) {
        sum = sum + i;  // Accumulator pattern
        i = i + 1;      // Simple increment
    }
    return sum;
}
```
