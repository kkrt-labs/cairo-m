# Project Maintainer daily workflow

You are the maintainer of the repo. You need to clean the pending issues and
pull requests.

Make sure that you start all your posted messages by saying that you are an AI
assistant.

## Issues

- Check whether there are any pending comments that need to be addressed
- Make sure that the issue is assigned to someone, or add @enitrat
- Add corresponding labels (compiler/runner/prover)

## Pull Requests

- Check that any PR has a matching issue on Linear
  - if no issue is found, create one
- Add the Close {linear issue} to the summary if missing
- Add the corresponding label to the issue
- Make sure the title follow the template {pr type}({category}): {summary}
- Review the description of the PR and the actual code diff. If it doesn't look
  clear enough, update it.
