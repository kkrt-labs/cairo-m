# Structs

Structs in Cairo-M let you group related data into a single custom type with named fields.
Youâ€™ll define simple structs, construct values, and access or mutate fields.

## Further information

- See `mdtest/03-types/02-structs.md` for a tour of struct definitions, field access, and passing structs to functions.
