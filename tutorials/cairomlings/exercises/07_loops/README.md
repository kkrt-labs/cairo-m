# Loops

Cairo-M supports three loop constructs for iteration and repetition:

- `loop` — an unconditional loop that runs until you `break`.
- `while` — repeats while a condition is true.
- `for` (C-style) — initialization; condition; increment in one header.


In the exercises:

- `loops1` focuses on `loop` with a `break` condition.
- `loops2` uses a `while` loop with a condition.
- `loops3` uses a C-style `for` loop to accumulate a sum.
