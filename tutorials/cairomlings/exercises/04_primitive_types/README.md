# Primitive Types

Cairo-M provides two core primitive types you’ll use everywhere:
- `felt` — a field element in the M31 field (fast arithmetic, limited comparisons/bitwise)
- `u32` — a 32-bit unsigned integer (supports comparisons and arithmetic with wrapping semantics)

In this exercise you’ll practice declaring, annotating, and operating on these types.

## Further information

- See `mdtest/01-basics/03-primitive-types.md` for guided examples of `felt` and `u32`.
- See `mdtest/01-basics/01-literals.md` for numeric literal forms and suffixes.
